Answers to the lab questions:
answer #1
The App.js file is the file for the actual app where we have the project code. This also kickstarts the app.

answer #2
The node_modules file contains all of the different packages and dependencies required for this project to work.

answer #3
The .gitignore file is for version control, tracking the files that are needed and ignoring the ones not needed.

answer #4
The package.json file is where we have information of our project like the name, what platforms it runs on, the icons, splash images etc.
