@REM So what does that P1.ID < P2.ID clause do in the last example query?
@REM It finds all instances where there is the same name in the two duplicate sheets and returns the name where there is a different id

@REM The query that joined the Player table to itself seems rather contrived. Can you think of a realistic situation in which youâ€™d want to join a table to itself?
@REM When the table references itself. For example at a company where employees have supervisors that are also employees.
